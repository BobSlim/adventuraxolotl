<h1>The Game</h1>
<p>You are the secretary of an inter-governmental organisation. Your role is to ensure that peace and unity reigns across Lissamphibia, using your powers of negotiation, diplomacy, and spycraft.</p>
<p>Each year, you will host a meeting of the nations, where the leaders will decide on how the world will look like for the coming years. In between, you'll visit the leaders and their people, find out the issues of today, and make some friends, enemies, or even... lovers?</p>
<p>Ensure that you keep the trust of the leaders, otherwise you'll be fired. Speaking of, here they are now!</p>
